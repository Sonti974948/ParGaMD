# Parallelizable Gaussian Accelerated Molecular Dynamics (ParGaMD)
ParGaMD is a hybrid method that leverages the accelerated sampling of Gaussian Accelerated Molecular Dynamics (GaMD) and marries it with the excellent parallelization of the Weighted Ensemble (WE) framework, resulting in a powerful method that can speed up protein simulations. 

Please follow the given steps in order to successfully perform a ParGaMD simulation: 

## 1. Perform a GaMD simulation for a short time to get the GaMD parameters
