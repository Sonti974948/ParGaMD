# Parallelizable Gaussian Accelerated Molecular Dynamics (ParGaMD)
ParGaMD is a hybrid method that leverages the accelerated sampling of Gaussian Accelerated Molecular Dynamics (GaMD) and marries it with the excellent parallelization of the Weighted Ensemble (WE) framework, resulting in a powerful method that can speed up protein simulations.
